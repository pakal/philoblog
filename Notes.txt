DEV NOTES
==========

- rst plugin displays "raw" content in edit mode, without django-terms annotations ; whereas normal text plugin directly displays "rendered" content ; it's all normal

- django-terms doesn't support regexes in the list of term variants, alas ; so we must recognize use typography characters which might appear on final html, like curly quotes

- django-newsletter cron tasks have problem with generating URLs, since they have no active language ; a fallback urlpattern has been added for now, until we update django
